ERRORS / To-Do (none will be deleted from this list--their solutions will be added below for reference).

1. 'Pause' comes miracoulously unpaused upon the level ending.
2. Ships come off of the battle carrier eratically. The mapping of milliseconds to ship does not act as we expect.
3. No ships demonstrate acceleration.
4. No ships demonstrate a value r such that r is their overall velocity. Currently, a dx and dy are independent of one another and thus diagonal movement is faster than single direction.
5. Ships may 'overlap' and do not bounce off of each other. This is unrealistic.
6a. In ScrollingGamePanelOnePlayer, the method "private void loadNewSprites()" populates a list each iteration, then checks to see if it is null. Ideally, a list would not need to be populated each time.
6a1. With a fix as discussed in the comments, now the list sometimes returns null, even when it should not. This is unclear.
6b. In abstract class Level, "public synchronized Collection<GameSprite> unloadAllSprites(double timestamp)" uses a one-by-one pull of the ships needed, without regard for the efficiency that may be provided by a native method to the TreeMap structure.

==============

Fixes for Second Iteration:

1. Scrolling Background: There is now a background on each level, which moves as if the player is traveling.
1b. Layered scrolling background: On the second and third levels, there are overlays which simulate layering. If you look carefully, there may be enemies hiding beneath the clouds...
1c. 'Stagnant' ships on scrolling background: Some ships are written to correspond to the background instead of the foreground--they may hide beneath the scenery in each level.
2. Multiple levels implemented: three levels are well-defined.
3. More ships created.
3a. More bullets and non-linear actions for sprites: some ships explode and release "schrapnel"; some bullets do the same.
4. Sounds created for more levels: an additional sound was created by Paul.
